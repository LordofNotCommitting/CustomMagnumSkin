Apply your custom Magnum skin design to show Quasimorphs what you are made out of.

**This mod does not actually contain the thumbnail Magnum skin, Mostly to avoid copyright issue. You have to make your own as per instruction below.**

All the below images should be in the mod's folder. Which is in "[steam installed path]\steamapps\workshop\content\2059170\3609514958". If you are not on steam, png images should be in the same folder as CustomMagnumSkin.dll.
This mod uses "new_MagnumMain.png" as a skin if this file exist under said folder.
If this image for skin does not exist, this mod uses "default_MagnumMain.png".

**This mod contains "MagnumMain_Cleaned.png" which is clean magnum skin you can use to create your own "new_MagnumMain.png". Go nuts.**

I have also reduced the natural ship lighting in realspace because images were blinding with it on.

Changelog:

v1.2

My beautiful texture were being smudged by my terrible load of png file, which is now fixed.

v1.1

Now also support the antenna texture override, and this mod now also contain "default_ship_devises.png" which you can also edit. Save antenna as "new_ship_devises.png" on the same folder and it will be used over default one.
