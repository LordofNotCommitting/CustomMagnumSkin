Apply your custom Magnum skin design to show Quasimorphs what you are made out of.

**This mod does not actually contain the thumbnail Magnum skin, Mostly to avoid copyright issue. You have to make your own as per instruction below.**

All the below images should be in the mod's folder. Which is in "[steam installed path]\steamapps\workshop\content\2059170\3609514958". If you are not on steam, png images should be in the same folder as CustomMagnumSkin.dll.
This mod uses "new_MagnumMain.png" as a skin if this file exist under said folder.
If this image for skin does not exist, this mod uses "default_MagnumMain.png".

**This mod contains "MagnumMain_Cleaned.png" which is clean magnum skin you can use to create your own "new_MagnumMain.png". Go nuts.**

I have also reduced the natural ship lighting in realspace because images were blinding with it on.
